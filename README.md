# newsLinks_Webscraper

![](output.png)

Two files are generated:
1. newsLinks.txt
2. newsLinksCleaned.txt

## Modification
For a different website set the variable newsWebsite to the link.
The cleaning of the extracted data can be modified using the clean_data function.

This is a very rudimentary code and might have bugs. Feedback and criticism is welcomed and appreciated.
